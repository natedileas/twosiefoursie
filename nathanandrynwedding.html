                <h3>Venue</h3>
                <p>Cumming Nature Center is a nature preserve with hiking trails, so please feel free to bring shoes
                    which
                    you can hike the trails in. They will be open to us prior and following the ceremony. The ceremony
                    and
                    reception will be taking place outdoors, so dress accordingly. The ceremony is just a short walk
                    from
                    the parking lot, but there are wheelchairs at the venue that we can borrow for anyone who requires
                    assistance. The reception will be in a heated tent which will help with the elements. The nature
                    center's exhibits and bathrooms are indoors.</p>

                <p>Please note that there is limited cell and data service at the venue. If you require directions to
                    get
                    home after the event, we recommend downloading or printing those before traveling down. Usually it
                    takes
                    a while to reconnect to service when you leave the venue.</p>

                <p>We are not reserving any hotel space, but if you need any recommendations, we can let you know of a
                    few
                    places nearby to the venue.</p>

                <h3> Our Story </h3>
                <p>Nathan (he/him) and Ryn (they/them) met in the summer of 2014 while we were both working as
                    camp counselors at Lake Chautauqua Lutheran Center. We quickly bonded over sailing and
                    books. With Nate being on sailing staff that year, they got a lot of time on the water.
                    We went to college 4 hours away from each other for the next 3 years. Despite the distance,
                    we stayed in love. We shared book and tv recommendations while apart, and played board games
                    together when we got to see each other. In the summer of 2018, we finally moved in together
                    with Ryn's cat. The apartment was small and ridden with problems, but it was better than the
                    distance. In 2019, we rented a house, allowing Ryn to finally collect their childhood dog
                    from their parents. In the years that followed, we weathered changes in jobs, quarantine,
                    and Ryn bringing home a second kitten. Nathan proposed in June 2023, on our 9 year
                    anniversary.
                    In October 2023, we bought our home. It needed a lot of love, but by December we were able
                    to move in with the three pets. We're looking forward to the next chapter of our story
                    together.
