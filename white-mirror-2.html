            <h1>White Mirror: Story Zero</h1>

            meta note; I write these in vscode in with no spell check, no editor, and no llm. I will not be
            taking grammer [sic] corrections.

            <h2>q1</h2>

            1. What does “Fact imitates fiction” mean? In context of the previous paragraph, can you find a real example
            of this happening in your world?

            This is one of those questions its impossible to answer without sounding like the avatar of the god of the
            copybook headings. As simply as I can: The stories we tell and are told, shape reality. Abel gets told he's
            a real boy. Cain gets shamed. You know how that one ends. Obviously this can't change the bare facts of
            reality. But when the most important thing is the "human factor" (feels somewhat too specific nowadays)
            sometimes this
            is enough to make a difference.

            Real example; I do a lot of my own car maintainence. Knowledge is
            power in a very clear way with these kinds of tasks. Imagining "what would car guy nate do?" in this
            situtation is a reliable way of getting around something or more importantly, choosing what not to do.
            Picking a persona and somewhat intentionally inhabiting it is wonderful for peace of mind and

            2. “The LLM was trained on a Borgesian corpus” -> this refers to Jorge Luis Borges. What is he known for?
            Why
            would Lucilius train an LLM specifically on this one author?

            I don't know much about Borges. He's one of those people aspiring and perspiring literati seem to be
            obsessed with. I think he was midcentury, modernist, metafictional.

            Why? First, it's not trained only on Borges ( instead"all the books I've ever read, everthing I've
            written"), it's a metaphor. This is a
            message from the author to us; either he is signalling high status, or communicating something about the
            nature of the work at hand. As a pratical matter, it sounds like a terrible corpus. Don't you want your
            super LLM to be more widely read than you? For the sake of argument I will pretend he is fine tuning.

            3. If living in fear is a self fulfilling prophecy, and we know that, why can't we just NOT do that anymore?
            What's the bottleneck?

            Because change is quite difficult and gradual for most people. Just like any large shift in beliefs, it
            requires proof. The greater the claim, the greater the proof. Some people have been living in fear their
            whole lives, and have seen it reinforced over and over. The bottleck is condition and information.

            If you could wave a magic wand and fix, say, all appliances everywhere, instantly, perfectly. They'll keep
            running without fail, not needing parts or electricity. That's condition.
            Information; around me (NE US), some people are going to keep hiring furnace maintainance for quite a
            while - they
            <i>know</i> that the chimney is going to get blocked or the heat excahnger will
            crack and they will be cold and miserable for a few days at best. They need to become convinced that there
            are in fact, no downsides.

            In real life, the physical and information problem is enormous. The Memome is heavily contested. <label
                for="mn-memome" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="mn-memome" class="margin-toggle" />

            <span class="marginnote">Why aren't we talking about religion when it comes to the Memome? Christianity,
                Islam, the enlightenment,
                nationalism, communism all seem to be primarily memome phenomena. Fiction which became fact, in bigger
                ways
                that anything to do with AI (yet).</span>

            Personally, I try to live in as little fear as possible. But to be honest, there are real things to be
            scared of in the world - car crash, cancer, dementia, nukes, etc. And sometimes fear is a useful signal. The
            problem is when it's an unreliable barometer, and we run inside to hide from nonexistant thunderstorms.

            Also; assuming the consequent. There isn't any real proof that fear is a self fulfilling prophecy, even if
            we believe it is.

            I have to say, I'm disappointed by the book so far. I'm perhaps too hardheaded at times, but there's been a
            couple glaring errors relating to programming which annoyed me. Several of the stories aren't really
            WHITE mirror. More like, near future, god in a box shows up and yaps at Lucilius while thin metaphors for
            LSD experimentation or the simulation hypothesis play out.

            Is the whole thing more or less about LLMs? There are other things in the world. The world is a huge,
            amazing place. As a description of a utopia I much prefer the <a href="TODO">WTC epilogues</a>. Simple lack
            of physical threat and implied leisure isn't enough.

            Obviously llms and broader applications of AI will heavily affect the future. But I think we have almost no
            information on which way. I think that in 20, 40 or 80 years, life will be pretty much the same as today.
            That's my lifespan. Planning too far beyond that isn't my task, but the generations below me. If a powerful
            actor could guarantee no nuclear war and a comfortable life for my family in that period, I would certainly
            switch my allegiance. But it would take more than being able to generate some nice-sounding and
            scary-sounding ideas.
