    <h1>The good future</h1>
    <p>I'm intending to read White Mirror as part of <a
            href="https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/white-mirror-reading-guide-pt-0">this</a>.
        Here are some assorted thoughts before starting.
    </p>

    <h2>Descriptive</h2>
    <p>What does a good future look like 100 years from now?
        In 2125, unsought toil doesn't exist. Almost no one is trash picking to eat.
        <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle" />
        <span class="marginnote">
    Except for permies and youtubers and maybe historical reenactors?
    </span>
        War is fought with no humans dying.
        Most people die at 90 or up, except for daredevils in accidents.
        Travel is cheap. Lots of people see the five largest countries by cultural impact before they die. By our
        standards, there are robots everywhere. Mostly they don't look like us.
    </p>

    <p>
        Society doesn't look that different.
        There's probably still nationalism and hierarchachal organizations and implicit bias and ants and mosquitoes.
        There's bad neighborhoods and theft. Most people even still "work" for a living.
        Some people still hit their kids and cheat on their spouses and shit in the punch bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
        In areas which speak the same language
        <label for="mn-lang" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="mn-lang" class="margin-toggle" />

        there is a more generally accepted code of conduct, and some laws which transcend borders. Conviction or
        acquittal happens extremely quickly by today's standards, and basically splits into 2 paths; inpatient or
        outpatient counseling.
    </p>
            <span class="marginnote">
                And there are probably only a handful of languages. Sorry, linguists who have spent their lifetimes writing
                papers on a dialect only spoken in 1 specific kitchen in 1987.
            </span>
    <p>
        There's a work of art which if you saw it now, would bring you to tears. It is considered passá¼‘ and not spoken
        about in certain circles.
    </p>
    <p>Speaking of social circles; there's way more of them.
        <label for="mn-end" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="mn-end" class="margin-toggle" />
            <span class="marginnote">
            There's a huge amount of interesting ways a hundred years from now is different which this margin is
            too small to contain.
        </span>
        </p>

    <h2>Prescriptive</h2>
    <p>What needs to happen for us to end up here and not somewhere else? </p>
    <p>Social changes. Credible threats of personal and wide-spread harm needs to become harder. Large groups need to
        get better at communicating and committing. Individuals need to be smarter and kinder.</p>
    <p>Technological changes. Labor needs to become cheap and democratized. Food needs to be cheaper. Communication and
        travel et cetera.</p>
    <p>I'd rate our curent progress as poor. But second prize might be pretty good!</p>

    <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I'm excited to read a positive account of the future. I am slightly worried that it will be too unmoored. It's
        easy to write a bunch of words about how good something will be, now more than ever. We'll see!</p>
